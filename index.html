    <h1>The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed the way humans interact with technology, automating tasks, enhancing decision-making, and revolutionizing industries. From simple rule-based systems to advanced machine learning, AI has evolved significantly over the years.</p>
    <p>From early theoretical foundations to modern deep learning models, AI has been a testament to human ingenuity and technological progress.</p>

    <h2>Milestones in AI Development</h2>

    <h3>The Early Years</h3>
    
    <h4>The Birth of AI</h4>
    <p>The concept of AI was first introduced in the 1950s, with Alan Turing proposing the idea of machines that could simulate human intelligence. The Turing Test became a foundational benchmark for AI.</p>
    <h4>Expert Systems</h4>
    <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, expert systems were developed to mimic human decision-making, such as MYCIN for medical diagnosis and DENDRAL for chemical analysis.</p>

    <h3>The Rise of Machine Learning</h3>

    <h4>Neural Networks</h4>
    <p>The resurgence of neural networks in the 1990s led to breakthroughs in pattern recognition, speech processing, and image classification.</p>
    <h4>Big Data and AI</h4>
    <p>The explosion of big data in the 2000s fueled AI growth, enabling machine learning models to process vast amounts of information efficiently.</p>
    
    <h3>Modern AI Applications</h3>

    <h4>Deep Learning</h4>
    <p>Deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, have revolutionized AI applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.</p>
    <h4>AI in Everyday Life</h4>
    <p>AI is now embedded in everyday life, from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to recommendation systems used by Netflix and Amazon.</p>
    
    <h3>The Future of AI</h3>

    <h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>
    <p>As AI continues to advance, ethical concerns such as bias, privacy, and job displacement must be addressed to ensure responsible AI development.</p>
    <h4>Next-Generation AI</h4>
    <p>Research in artificial general intelligence (AGI) and quantum computing promises to push AI beyond its current limitations, shaping the future of technology and society.</p>
